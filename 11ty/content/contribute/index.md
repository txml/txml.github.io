title: contribute to txml or its documentation
---
We are working hard to provide you the most effective way to work with xml data. In order to do that properly, it would be great if you can support us. You can support us in different ways:

 1. use txml and benefit from its speed and the clear structure it provides.
 2. give feedback, open a issue on [github](https://github.com/TobiasNickel/tXml/issues).
 3. You can even create a PR. But we do not want you to wast a lot of effort and not having the change merged. Your time is valuable. Feel free to contact us first with a new open issue.
 4. help on this website. On this website we want to provide a documentation that does deeper than it is possible on the projects readme file. We want to show how all the methods are used and show how options effect the outcome. With examples we want to show how some real data is used with the library.
